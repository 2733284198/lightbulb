# Progressive Ansible

These roles/playbooks are meant to show how to use Ansible in a progressive way. Meaning, start with simple concepts, and keep building upon those concepts along the way.

In each lesson, you will find an overview of what that lesson is trying to teach.

In their current form, they don't provide detailed instruction -- that is left up to the instructor. Think of these more as instructor's notes than student material, but of course they could be used as reference.
