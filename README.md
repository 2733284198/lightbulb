# Ansible Lightbulb

The Ansible Lightbulb project is an effort to provide a reference and educational content for rapidly communicating and learning Ansible and Ansible Tower essentials.

Lightbulb began life as the content that supported Ansible's training program before it joined the Red Hat family focused solely on Linux server automation.

This content is now taking on a new life as a multi-purpose toolkit for effectively demonstrating Ansible's capabilities or providing informal workshop training in various forms -- instructor-led, hands-on or self-paced. 

Over time lightbulb will be expanded to include advanced and developer topics in addition to expanding beyond linux server automation and into Windows and network automation.

To support these objectives, the project provides a lab provisiover tool for creating an environment to present and work with lightbulb content. 

**NOTE:** Lightbulb "v2" is currenly a work in progress and still has not met all of its intended goals. 

#### Assumed Knowledge

For hands-on or self-paced training, students should have working knowledge of using SSH and command line shell (BASH). The ability to SSH from their personal laptop to a lab environment hosted in a public cloud can also be required based dependent on the format and presentation of the context. 

For demos and instrcutor-led exercises, conceptual understanding of linux system admin, DevOps and distributed application architecture is all that is required.
