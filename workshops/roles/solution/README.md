# Workshop: Roles

Here students are tasked with refactoring their previous work from the Basic Playbook workshop into a role and modifying their playbook accordingly. We specifically avoid introducing any new tasks or functionality otherwise. The objective here is to focus students specifically on how roles are structured and develop. 

You should emphasize roles value in better organizing playbooks as they grow in sophistication and making Ansible automation more portable and reusable than a basic playbook.

#### NOTE

The extra credit assignment should use the `include_role` module that was introduced in version 2.2. Students working with older versions of Ansible will have trouble completing the assignment.

### Solution

The solution to this workshop is `nginx-role` under `examples/`. This example also includes the solution to the extra credit assignment. See `remove.yml` and `roles/nginx-basic/tasks/remove.yml`. <-- TODO
